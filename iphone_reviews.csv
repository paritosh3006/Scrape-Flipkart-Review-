1,As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it’s worth buying on this budget..4/5 my rating
2,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.  Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.

6,"Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it. It’s super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours.

392,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.  Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.
393,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1.

394,"One word.. beautiful iphone ❤️ premium feelJust go for it without any doubt. Superb camera, handy, white color is soo good. This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones."
395,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery. Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins. Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins. Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I’m using. I’m not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn’t look nice to me.

It’s super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you..."
397,"The powerful small phone that I always wished for !!Nowadays the fad is big screen phones but for me, I like a small powerful phone with awesome camera. Ticked all the boxes that I had in my mind. Switched from android. Never going back!"
398,"Like It, Apple SE very nice and handy mobile, we can use it by single hand, like it too much if you are going single handy mobile you can go with Apple SE 2020 without any hesitation."
399,"As being a frequent apple user, I couldn't find much of a difference when comparing to IPhone 6.The size and display are the same of IPhone 6 and ofcourse there is 0 negative comments for the A13 chip. It is super fast✌️.Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.No negative comments for the camera, apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights, a front facing portrait camera, a wider photo fr..."

401,As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it’s worth buying on this budget..4/5 my rating
